We do not permanently store any information entered into our app, and we take great care to ensure that all information is deleted from our cache when it is no longer needed.

We take the privacy and security of our users very seriously, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. By using our app, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any loss or damage that may result from any unauthorized access to your personal information, whether due to our app's vulnerabilities or your own actions.

We reserve the right to update these Terms and Conditions at any time, and we encourage you to review them periodically. Your continued use of our app after any changes to these Terms and Conditions will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.
